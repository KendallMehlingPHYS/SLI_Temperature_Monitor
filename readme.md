# SLI Temperature Plotting 

`temp_live_plotter.py` opens monitoring plot which will plot the temperature locally in a Python environment.
`web_plotter.py` will open a local [127.0.0](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) which will interactively update JS plots. 

```
screen
python3 /media/j/temp_control_v3/web_plotter/web_plotter.py
```
detach the screen by ctrl+a and ctrl+d.

To see the plot, go `yecountvoncount.colorado.edu:8000` with the browser.

## TODO
Looks like it takes some resources. Change the plot format to `.svg`
